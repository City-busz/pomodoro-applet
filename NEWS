Version 0.4

  * Added an icon that will appear in the "Add to Panel" dialog.
  * Added an about dialog so the context menu doesn't have a separator
    with nothing above it and for better consistency with other applets.

Version 0.3

  * Moved the applet out of $PREFIX/bin and into
    $PREFIX/lib/pomodoro-applet since the binary is not meant to be
    invoked directly.

Version 0.2

  * First unstable release.
